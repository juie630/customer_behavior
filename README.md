# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, covering data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business-focused visualization.
The objective is to transform raw data into **actionable insights** using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and communicate findings through a structured report and presentation.

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** CSV / relational database (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
* **Type:** Structured tabular data
* **Contents:**

  * Numerical features (e.g., quantities, prices, metrics)
  * Categorical features (e.g., customer segments, product categories, regions)
  * Time-based fields (e.g., dates, periods)

> Note: The dataset is used only for analytical and learning purposes.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Databases & Querying:**

  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
  * SQL Server
* **Data Visualization & BI:** Power BI
* **Reporting & Presentation:**

  * Analytical Report (PDF / DOC)
  * Gamma (PPT / presentation deck)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts

## Project Workflow / Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported dataset using Python (CSV / database connection).
   * Verified schema, data types, and row counts.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics and distributions.
   * Missing value and outlier detection.
   * Correlation and trend analysis.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing values and duplicates.
   * Standardized formats and corrected data types.
   * Created derived and analytical features.

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server.
   * Wrote SQL queries for:

     * Aggregations and KPIs
     * Trend and segment analysis
     * Business-oriented insights

5. **Visualization & Dashboarding**

   * Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.
   * Included KPIs, filters, and drill-down views.

6. **Insights & Reporting**

   * Compiled insights into a structured analytical report.
   * Created a professional presentation using **Gamma** for stakeholder communication.

## Dashboard

The **Power BI dashboard** highlights:

* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Trends over time
* Segment-wise and category-wise performance
* Interactive filters for deeper analysis

The dashboard is designed to support **data-driven decision-making**.

---

## Results & Key Insights

* Identified major trends and patterns in the data.
* Highlighted high-performing and underperforming segments.
* Converted raw data into clear, business-relevant insights.
* Demonstrated integration of Python, SQL, and BI tools in a single workflow.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**

   * Install Python (3.x)
   * Install required libraries:

     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
     ```

3. **Run Analysis**

   * Open and execute Jupyter notebooks / Python scripts for EDA and cleaning.

4. **Database Analysis**

   * Load cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server.
   * Execute provided SQL queries.

5. **View Dashboard**

   * Open the Power BI (.pbix) file to explore the dashboard.

6. **Reports & Presentation**

   * Review the final report and Gamma-based presentation for summarized insights.
